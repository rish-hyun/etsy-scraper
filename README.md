The [EtsyScraper](https://github.com/rish-hyun/etsy-scraper/blob/main/EtsyScraper.ipynb) includes code to scrape data from _**Etsy shop**_

I've tested it on Colab.
<hr>

Enter the shop name in cell no. 3 <br>
> `shop_name = '---x-Shop-Name-x---'`

<br>

The following items are scraped and saved in csv file using pandas.
